      <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the<br />
        world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a<br />
        round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is<br />
        no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which <br />
        all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be <br />
        truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

      <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good <br />
        and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings <br />
        about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

      <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set <br />
        foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
      
      <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon <br />
      seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's <br />
      how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and <br />
      cherish her.</p>

      <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and <br />
        perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes <br />
        your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more <br />
        valuable than those which divide us.</p>
